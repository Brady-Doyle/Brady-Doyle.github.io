                <p class = 'detail3'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is AI thinking or simply memorizing? This is a
                    question that is at the forefront of many minds when first learning about the world of AI.
                    It is likely our first thought as we are trying to belittle the power of AI to give us
                    intellectual security. But does it have some roots in truth? Despite the question's motivation,
                    it is reasonable to ask when considering how AI learns. AI's learning is split up into two
                    kinds of traing; pre-training and post-training. Pre-training is when the model is exposed to
                    a vast amount of general data. This can be in the form of supervised learning, unsupervised
                    learning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised learning. Supervised learning is
                    when you train a model on labelled data.<br><br>
