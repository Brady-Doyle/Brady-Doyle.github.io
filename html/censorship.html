                    Censorship is enacted through legislation and aims to protect the status quo,
                    often under the justification of safeguarding public safety, social harmony, or national
                    security. Recent legislative measures, such as Bill C-11, Bill C-18, and Bill C-64, raise
                    concerns about government overreach, media control, and suppression of dissenting
                    voices. While policymakers argue that these laws safeguard democracy by combating
                    misinformation and ensuring fair compensation for news outlets, critics contend that
                    they primarily serve elite interests, limiting access to diverse viewpoints and
                    undermining democratic engagement. Canadian citizens are frequently misinformed by
                    corporate-controlled media outlets, which prioritize elitist interests and, in doing so,
                    undermine democratic engagement and public discourse. Journalists are subjected to
                    enable elitists to drip-feed their agendas to the Canadian population unless they want to
                    lose their jobs. Recently, the shift in social media's popularity has displaced news media
                    and annihilated what we see regarding the new censorship legislation, the elite panic of
                    losing their mass narratives. While passing these legislations to maintain their elite
                    agendas, they are violating their country's citizens' fundamental human rights.<br><br>

                    Throughout this essay, the reader will be guided through contemporary debates
                    on censorship, following legal frameworks and key legislation, and the history of
                    censorship to better understand censorship as we know it today. This examination aims
                    to answer the question: What is the Canadian government's true motive for putting forth
                    legislation on censorship?<br><br>

                    <h3>Contemporary Debates</h3>

                    In this section, we will look at a few contemporary debates regarding censorship
                    issues: (1) The New Censorship, (2) Regulating Online Content, and (3) Government
                    Regulations.<br><br>

                    <h3>The New Censorship</h3>

                    Christine Van Geyn (2024), a Canadian constitutional lawyer, says there is an
                    uprising of new censorship empowered by the government through legislation and
                    regulation, which is used to stomp down dissenting viewpoints. These are done through
                    professional private regulating bodies to whom the government gives authority.
                    Professional regulators oversee all fields, such as law, healthcare, education, psychology,
                    etc., and are empowered by the government through legislation. Canadians in regulated
                    professions need the government's permission to do their jobs. That permission is
                    granted by these self-regulating professional bodies that have their own sets of rules and
                    discipline. Geyn explains that professional regulators are subject to the Charter of
                    Rights and Freedoms when making their decisions and must only regulate off-duty
                    speech in the public interest. However, there have been cases when regulated
                    professionals off-duty express their personal ideas or beliefs and are subsequently
                    disciplined.<br><br>

                    An example is Dr. Jordan Peterson, who used social media to express his views
                    on various political, social, and cultural issues. The members of the public had strong
                    opinions about his views and filed complaints to the College of Psychologists of Ontario,
                    where he was subsequently disciplined. A problem is raised because “the result is that
                    professionals who express unpopular views are disciplined, regulators barely glance at
                    the Charter, and courts are deferential when they review that discipline” (Geyn, 2024).
                    Regulated professionals still retain their freedom of expression, a constitutionally
                    guaranteed right under Section 2(b) of the Charter. However, regulators punishing
                    professionals off-duty because of their views that are shaking up the status quo is
                    problematic.<br><br>

                    <h3>Regulating Online Content</h3>

                    With social media's rising popularity, people no longer use traditional news sites
                    to obtain information on current events. Instead, this information is obtained through
                    social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, to name a few.
                    Facebook and Instagram are owned by Meta, and YouTube is owned by Google, which
                    together are the most notable tech giants.<br><br>

                    Milton (2023) explains that the internet's disruption of the advertising-based
                    business model that had funded the news industry in Australia since the early 1900s was
                    in trouble. People would read the newspapers, publishers would sell their eyeballs to
                    advertisers, and advertisers would provide the cash needed to keep these newspapers
                    affordable. With the rise of the web and the monopolies accompanying it, this model
                    broke down. Google and Meta made online advertising far less lucrative. Today, the two
                    tech giants collect 90% of global advertising revenue, leaving little left to support the
                    media industry while enjoying the traffic from people seeking out the news. Australia
                    saw these detrimental changes to its news industry, with fewer people reading its
                    newspapers, revenue declining, and journalists laying off the masses. To remedy this,
                    the Australian government sought to rebalance the market by forcing Meta and Google
                    to pay Australian publishers for news linked on their platforms through legislation. The
                    law enacted by the Australian government in 2021 is called the Online Bargaining Code.<br><br>

                    As we know, Canada has seen issues that are scarcely similar to Australia's.
                    Milton (2023) states that Canada was encouraged by the Australian Online Bargaining
                    Code and began to lobby for similar legislation in 2021. Today, we know Bill C-18, the
                    Online News Act, which was similar to the Australian model and threatened Google and
                    Meta with binding arbitration unless they came to private agreements with the country’s
                    news organizations.<br><br>

                    Elistis who are tightly connected with the traditional news industry and
                    government, is concerned about the decreased gullibility of the upcoming generations.
                    Roderic Day (2022) explains that governments use news media as a tool to brainwash
                    and people no longer believe their lies. News media popularity threatens power elites
                    because we no longer follow the legacy media they use to spread their mass narratives.
                    Raising generations on social media only further contributes to the monopoly of social
                    media over news media, increasing the skepticism of our government's elites and
                    encouraging individuals to punch up instead of punch sideways for cultural issues. The
                    rise of new media is displacing news media and annihilating it. What is seen through the
                    uprising of new legislation being passed by governments is elite panic. Their
                    justifications for passing these legislations do not make sense, however, if you follow
                    their actions and motives, it all points towards them wedging themselves into these
                    social media areas where they can regain control. There are so many poked holes in the
                    evidence surrounding the reasons for the passed legislation that it does not make sense.
                    This leads to questioning why the governments are promoting and passing this
                    legislation. It is explained to be because of elite panic about losing their mass-narrative
                    control. Their plan works to limit access to these social media outlets to push individuals
                    back to their news media to force-feed them and brainwash them with their agendas.<br><br>

                    <h3>Government Regulations</h3>

                    Governments frequently justify media regulations by claiming they are essential
                    for ensuring accurate news reporting and preventing misinformation. Roderic Day
                    (2022) critiques this approach, describing it as a tactic used by elites to maintain control
                    over public discourse, saying, "The news must be reported correctly, but let people enjoy
                    things—artistic freedom is sacrosanct.” He then identifies this claim as nonsense
                    liberalism. He is right, why does the government care about the artistic freedom of
                    individuals on social media? By justifying their actions in these ways, the government
                    can have more control over Canadian citizens, and their force feeds them their elitist
                    agendas. With the openness of social media, there is room for debates and skepticism to
                    band together to fight against these elitist agendas. Canadians were stepping on the
                    elitist's toes by blaming them for our cultural issues rather than blaming themselves. No
                    longer were people believing these “liberal delusions arising from the powerful justifying
                    their abuse,” so they had to backtrack, wedging their narratives back to Canadians (Day,
                    2022).<br><br>

                    One example is Bill C-64 (Online Harms Act), which aims to combat hate speech
                    and misinformation. While proponents argue that such laws protect vulnerable
                    communities, critics warn that they grant excessive power to government bodies to
                    determine what constitutes "harmful content." The broad language of these laws risks
                    criminalizing legitimate dissent, leading to self-censorship and reduced political
                    engagement among citizens.<br><br>

                    <h3>Legal Framework and Key Legislation</h3>

                    In Section 2(b) of The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, everyone has
                    freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and
                    other media communication.<br><br>

                    In this section, we will look at specific legislation that breaches Section 2(b) of the
                    Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom in (1) Bill C-11 Online Streaming Act, (2) Bill
                    C-18 Online News Act, and (3) Bill C-64 Online Harms Act.<br><br>

                    <h3>Bill C-11 Online Streaming Act</h3>

                    Bill C-11, the Online Streaming Act, updates the previous broadcasting act to
                    include online streaming platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and TikTok. The federal
                    government introduced the bill to modernize broadcasting regulations and ensure that
                    digital platforms promote Canadian cultural content. The legislation grants the
                    Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) expanded
                    authority to regulate online platforms, requiring them to promote and financially
                    support Canadian content.<br><br>

                    Michael Geist (2024) explains that the Canadian government's decision to retain
                    an outdated model instead of modernizing the law has resulted in penalties for digital
                    success stories, “reflecting one of the world's most repressive online censorship
                    schemes.” Geist explains that there is little evidence supporting the need for mandated
                    discoverability on streaming services, yet this concept received strong backing from both
                    the industry and government. It raises questions about why discoverability became a
                    focal point for the Canadian creative sector when users can easily find Canadian content
                    by simply entering "Canada" in a search box or relying on algorithms (Geist, 2024).
                    Furthermore, Geist says there is ample opportunity for a modernized broadcasting law
                    that prioritizes consumers, competition, and a new generation of creators. Instead,
                    Canadians faced Bill C-11, which was less about genuine reform and more about panic
                    over the sector's viability. Despite Canadian culture's remarkable cultural and economic
                    significance, the government's reliance on unfounded fears may have introduced actual
                    harm, including decreased competition, increased consumer prices, and the potential
                    for a contentious trade battle with the United States (Geist, 2024).<br><br>

                    <h3>Bill C-18 Online News Act</h3>

                    As the Government of Canada’s website explains, “News outlets play a vital role
                    in maintaining a healthy democracy,” saying how the news industry “provides citizens
                    with critical information that helps them fully benefit and participate in a democratic
                    society.” They explain how most Canadians get their news online, with online
                    advertising revenues in Canada being fourteen billion, with two platforms receiving
                    roughly eighty percent of these revenues. These two platforms are Meta and Google.
                    Furthermore, they explain that digital platforms earn billions in online advertising, but
                    their poor news outlets shutter each year due to the loss of advertising revenue from
                    Meta and Google. With the introduction of Bill C-18, they were able to level the playing
                    field, giving their power elites a fair chance against these tech giants. Bill C-18, The
                    Online News Act “aims to ensure that dominant platforms compensate news businesses
                    when their content is made available on their services.” Michael Geist (2024) explains
                    that Meta blocked all news links in response to Bill C-18.<br><br>

                    <h3>Bill C-64 Online Harms Act</h3>

                    The Government of Canada’s website says that Bill C-63 contains measures that address
                    a range of harmful content online. This includes hate speech and hate crimes both
                    online and offline. They explain that to combat harmful online content properly, there
                    must be accountability to social media services accountable for reducing exposure to
                    harmful content on their platforms. Michael Geist (2024) points towards the similarity
                    between the government's justifications for Bill C-11 and Bill C-18 and now the new Bill
                    C-63 as another way of gaslighting since the response of Meta blocking Canadian news
                    media in response to Bill C-18, Canadian media bankruptcies and closures continue to
                    mount. Bill C-63, the Online Harms Act, offered a chance for a fresh start as the
                    previous two Bills were failures. However, the government ran into challenges as there
                    were harsh criticisms of the bill and “After a second briefing failed to quell the concerns,
                    the Minister and officials in the PMO have gone back to the gaslighting playbook by
                    dismissing the criticism as clickbait, suggesting they involve a misunderstanding of the
                    law” (Geist).<br><br>

                    <h3>Historical Context of Censorship in Canada</h3>

                    In the next section, the paper will review the history of landmark legal cases and
                    legislation that have shaped free expression. Explored will be (1) the War Measures Act,
                    (2) the Constitution Act, and (3) R v Keegstra.<br><br>

                    <h3>The War Measures Act 1914</h3>

                    Originally introduced during World War I, the War Measures Act granted the
                    federal government broad powers to suppress dissent and censor information. Its use
                    during the October Crisis of 1970 resulted in the mass detention of political dissidents,
                    illustrating how national security concerns can be leveraged to justify civil liberties
                    violations. The War Measures Act gave the government arbitrary powers to conduct the
                    war while protecting national interests. This allowed the executive to write new laws
                    without the need to go through Parliament. The Act restricted the civil liberties of
                    Canadians, imposing censorship. Those who went against and shared their views were
                    subsequently disciplined. Keshen (2015) said that censorship in Canada started by
                    focusing on telegraph messages to try to ensure that military-sensitive news was not
                    leaked. Censorship soon expanded to newspapers as leaked information, such as details
                    about the troopships, were publicly available. Problems have been raised however since
                    the bombarding of propaganda with no room for freedom of expression. There was no
                    way to freely debate the issues of the war. They used censorship strategically however, it
                    opened the doors later in history for a more intelligent form of the tool.<br><br>

                    <h3>The Constitution Act</h3>

                    The Constitution Act of 1867 brought to Canada a constitution “similar in
                    principle to that of the United Kingdom,” though it was silent about liberties accruing to
                    individuals. The Supreme Court of Canada, which was also not a part of the Constitution
                    Act of 1867, which was made through organic statute, had seen cases and prepared to
                    enact laws regarding free speech. Roach and Schneiderman (2013) say that the Alberta
                    Press Case was quoted “free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its
                    incidental mischiefs, [as] the breath of life for parliamentary institutions,” which would
                    have permitted substantial governmental interference with the operation of newspapers
                    in the province (p. 431). However, it was ruled that it was beyond the provincial
                    competence, for it curtailed the right of public discussion and trenched the federal
                    criminal law power.<br><br>

                    <h3>R v Keegstra</h3>

                    James Keegstra, a teacher, was convicted under Section 319 of the Criminal Code for
                    promoting Holocaust denialism in his classroom. In his case, Dickson C.J.C applied that
                    not all expressions were equally deserving of consideration under Section 1 (Roach &
                    Schneiderman 2013, p. 435). Dickinson C. J. C found that “the promotion of hatred
                    ‘propagate[s] ideas anathemic to democratic values’ does not advance the pursuit of
                    truth, and denies self-fulfilment to the targeted minority” (Roach & Schneiderman, p.
                    438). This case remains a landmark example of the tension between free expression and
                    public safety concerns in Canada upholding freedom of expression.<br><br>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    Censorship in Canada has evolved from wartime restrictions to modern
                    regulatory frameworks governing digital spaces. While legislations such as Bill C-11, Bill
                    C-18, and Bill C-64 are justified as protective measures, they often result in greater
                    government control over the information Canadians can view. This consolidates media
                    power rather than ensuring press freedom as guaranteed in Section 2(b) of the Charter.
                    The government's increasing control and the rise of traditional media run by
                    government elites raise concerns about transparency and the Canadian government.<br><br>

                    As highlighted by experts like Christine Van Geyn, the emergence of new
                    censorship tactics demonstrates how legislative measures can stifle dissenting voices
                    under the guise of public interest and societal cohesion. The challenges regulated
                    professionals like Dr. Jordan Peterson face underscore the precarious balance between
                    upholding free expression and maintaining professional standards.<br><br>

                    As Canadians increasingly turn to social media platforms for news and
                    information, the traditional media model is disrupted, leading to significant
                    implications for democracy and public discourse. Ultimately, the true motive behind
                    media legislation in Canada should align with the principles of democracy, ensuring that
                    the fundamental rights of citizens to freely express and access a broad spectrum of ideas
                    remain protected and that censorship and governmental control are absent. Only by
                    ensuring open access to diverse perspectives can Canada uphold its commitment to
                    democracy and free expression.
