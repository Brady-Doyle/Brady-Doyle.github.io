                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Brady Doyle. Let me tell you a little about myself. I am twenty years old
                    and live in British Columbia, Canada, specifically, Vancouver. Actually that isn't the wholen truth;
                    I am currently living in Rossland, BC in the interior temporarily on a work term, but more on that later. 
                    Originally I am from Nanaimo, BC on Vancouver Island which is a not very well known city for people outside of 
                    Canada's west coast and most people will ask if its near Victoria (the photo above is in Victoria so I can't blame anyoen). 
                    As you can see I have moved a lot in the last few years, Nanaimo to Vancouver to Rossland and soon back to Vancouver.
                    I go to The University of British Columbia for electrical engineering. I am currently doing a co-op through 
                    UBC at Teck Resources Limited in Trail, BC, which is fifteen minutes from Rossland. Hence why I am live in 
                    Rossland. I am a Control Engineering Co-op at Teck which has been very interesting and has taught me a lot.
                </p><br>
                <h3>The Story Behind this Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this website was born where all great ideas are born: in the shower. Well, kind of.
                    I began creating this website just to learn how to. But I had to find a purpose for the site, so I decided to 
                    make the site for what everyone does when creating a website, and make it a personal portfolio. I created the whole original website
                    around this purpose. Eventually I realized that I probably wouldn't be able to create a better portfolio than LinkedIn can 
                    and I quickly lost motivation. I then took some time away from working on this site but one day in the shower I was 
                    thinking about what people will be missing in the near to mid future. What I thought of was something that we 
                    are already struggling with which is the increasing lack of being about to decipher between AI and humans. This is especially 
                    concerning when considering ideas that are conveyed through writing. It is increasingly difficult to tell if a block of text 
                    was created by humans or AI without running it through an AI checker. This is when I thought of the idea to change my website 
                    to have the purpose of hosting peoples ideas while ensuring they are HUMAN ideas. So there, that is the idea of 
                    this website. Although you may be realizing that there is nowhere on this site that indicates that the articles are purely written 
                    by humans or any AI checking. That is because there isn't. I decided that in the early days, I will keep this site as open to any articles; 
                    no restricitions. When/if the website grows, I will begin to enact this purpose in the website. This will hopefully create 
                    a safe place for humans to share and consume ideas that they can be confident were created by fellow humans.
