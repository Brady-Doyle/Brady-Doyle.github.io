                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Brady Doyle. Let me tell you a little about myself. I am twenty years old 
                    and live in British Columbia, Canada, specifically Vancouver. Actually, that isn't the whole truth. 
                    I currently live in Rossland, BC in the interior. I am here on a co-op work term, but more on that later. 
                    Originally, I am from Nanaimo, BC on Vancouver Island, which is not very well known to people outside of 
                    Canada's west coast. As you can see, I have moved a lot in the last few years, Nanaimo to Vancouver, Vancouver to 
                    Rossland, and soon back to Vancouver to continue my degree. I am in electrical engineering 
                    at The University of British Columbia and will be going back for my third year. 
                    I am currently doing a co-op term at Teck Resources' smelter in Trail, BC which is fifteen minutes from 
                    Rossland, hence why I live there. I am working as a Control Engineering Co-op which has been an interesting 
                    change from electrical engineering and has taught me a lot. It was at Teck where during a lunch and learn on instrumentation, I 
                    heard about radar devices. I began to wonder how exactly radar works and learned that it uses electromagnetic 
                    waves to detect objects. It does this by sending out EM waves and sensing when they get bounce off objects. 
                    This was also around the time when I was considering what type of electrical engineer I wanted to be. I decided I want 
                    to be a telecommunications engineer who use EM waves to transmit signals over distances. This specialization attracts 
                    me as I enjoy learning about physics and EM waves are a fundamental function of our universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a person outside of electrical engineering as well. My main hobbies are outdoor activities. I enjoy mountain biking, 
                    skiing, and I recently got into running. I began running about three months ago, so I'm not experienced in the field. 
                    Nevertheless, about a month after beginning I ran a half marathon in Vernon, BC. My time was 1 hour and 45 minutes which I thought was pretty good. Since then, I 
                    contracted a chest infection, so my weekly km's have dramatically declined. I'm hoping to get back into it once I get rid of this infection and 
                    maybe do a couple races during my third year of uni. As for skiing, one of my other favorite things to do, I have been able to enjoy the 2024/2025 ski 
                    season at Red Mountain in Rossland. It's a great mountain and was the third mountain I've ever skied, after my home hill Mount Washington and 
                    Sunshine Village which I visited this year during a two-day trip to Banff. This year at Red, I learned how to do a 360 and rails which was 
                    a big accomplishment. It helped that my roommate and ski partner was a ski instructor. Alright, enough about me, now I'll 
                    let you know how this website came to be.

                <h3>The Story Behind this Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this website was born where all great ideas are born: in the shower. Well, kind of. 
                    I began creating this website just to learn how to... well, create a website. But I had to find a purpose for the site, so I decided to 
                    make do what everyone does when creating a website and made it a personal portfolio. I created the whole original website 
                    around this purpose. Eventually I realized that I probably wouldn't be able to make a better portfolio website than LinkedIn 
                    and quickly lost motivation. I then took some time away from the site to ponder what to do with it. After months of not working on it, 
                    while taking a shower, I decided to make a site to host people's ideas and opinions. During this monumental shower, I was thinking about what 
                    people will be missing in the near to mid future. What I thought of was something that we 
                    are already struggling with: the ability, or lack of, to decipher between AI and human creations. This is especially 
                    concerning when considering how ideas are conveyed through writing. It is increasingly difficult to tell if a block of text 
                    was created by a human or AI without running it through an AI checker. This is when I thought to change my website 
                    to host articles that are written by HUMANS. So, there it is, the idea behind 
                    this website. At this point you may be realizing that there is nothing on this site that indicates that the articles should be purely written 
                    by humans or that they are checked for AI. That is because there isn't. I decided that in the early days of this site, I will it open to any articles with 
                    no restrictions. When/if the website grows, I will begin to enact this purpose on the website. This will hopefully create 
                    a safe place for humans to share and consume ideas and be confident they were created by fellow humans. As for now, just enjoy reading... AND PLEASE 
                    POST MORE ARTICLES.
